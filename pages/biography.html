        Muse are an English rock band from Teignmouth, Devon, formed in 1994.
        The band consists of Matt Bellamy (lead vocals, guitar, keyboards),
        Chris Wolstenholme (bass guitar, backing vocals), and Dominic Howard
        (drums). Muse released their debut album, Showbiz, in 1999, showcasing
        Bellamy's falsetto and a melancholic alternative rock style. Their
        second album, Origin of Symmetry (2001), incorporated wider
        instrumentation and romantic classical influences and earned them a
        reputation for energetic live performances. Absolution (2003) saw
        further classical influence, with strings on tracks such as "Butterflies
        and Hurricanes", and was the first of six consecutive UK number-one
        albums. Black Holes and Revelations (2006) incorporated electronic and
        pop elements, displayed in singles such as "Supermassive Black Hole",
        and brought Muse wider international success. The Resistance (2009) and
        The 2nd Law (2012) explored themes of government oppression and civil
        uprising and cemented Muse as one of the world's major stadium acts.
        Rolling Stone stated the band possessed "stadium-crushing songs".
        Topping the US Billboard 200, their seventh album, Drones (2015), was a
        concept album about drone warfare and returned to a harder rock sound.
        Their eighth album, Simulation Theory (2018), prominently featured
        synthesisers and was influenced by science fiction and the simulation
        hypothesis. Muse have won numerous awards, including two Grammy Awards,
        two Brit Awards, five MTV Europe Music Awards and eight NME Awards. In
        2012 they received the Ivor Novello Award for International Achievement
        from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. By June
        2016, they had sold over 20 million albums worldwide.

        The members of Muse played in separate school bands during their time at
        Teignmouth Community College in the early 1990s. Guitarist Matt Bellamy
        successfully auditioned for drummer Dominic Howard's band, Carnage
        Mayhem, becoming its singer and songwriter. They renamed the band Gothic
        Plague. They asked Chris Wolstenholme – at that time the drummer for
        Fixed Penalty – to join as bassist; he agreed and took up bass lessons.
        The band was renamed Rocket Baby Dolls and adopted a goth-glam image.
        Around this time, they received a £150 grant from the Prince's Trust for
        equipment. In 1994, Rocket Baby Dolls won a local battle of the bands,
        smashing their equipment in the process. Bellamy said, "It was supposed
        to be a protest, a statement, so, when we actually won, it was a real
        shock, a massive shock. After that, we started taking ourselves
        seriously." The band quit their jobs, changed their name to Muse, and
        moved away from Teignmouth. The band liked that the new name was short
        and thought that it looked good on a poster. According to journalist
        Mark Beaumont, the band wanted the name to reflect "the sense Matt had
        that he had somehow 'summoned up' this band, the way mediums could
        summon up inspirational spirits at times of emotional need".

        After a few years building a fanbase, Muse played their first gigs in
        London and Manchester supporting Skunk Anansie on tour. They had a
        significant meeting with Dennis Smith, the owner of Sawmills Studio,
        situated in a converted water mill in Cornwall. He had seen the three
        boys grow up as he knew their parents, and had a production company with
        their future manager Safta Jaffery, with whom he had recently started
        the record label Taste Media. The meeting led to their first serious
        recordings and the release of the Muse EP on 11 May 1998 on Sawmills'
        in-house Dangerous label, produced by Paul Reeve. Their second EP, the
        Muscle Museum EP, also produced by Reeve, was released on 11 January
        1999. It reached number 3 in the indie singles chart and attracted the
        attention of British radio broadcaster Steve Lamacq and the weekly
        British music publication NME. Later in 1999, Muse performed on the
        Emerging Artist's stage at Woodstock '99 and signed with Smith and
        Jaffery. Despite the success of their second EP, British record
        companies were reluctant to sign Muse. After a trip to New York's CMJ
        Festival, Nanci Walker, then Sr. Director of A&R at Columbia Records,
        flew Muse to the US to showcase for Columbia Records' then-Senior
        Vice-President of A&R, Tim Devine, as well as for American Recording's
        Rick Rubin. During this trip, on 24 December 1998, Muse signed a deal
        with American record label Maverick Records. Upon their return to
        England, Taste Media arranged deals for Muse with various record labels
        in Europe and Australia, allowing them control over their career in
        individual countries. John Leckie was brought in alongside Reeve to
        produce the band's first album, Showbiz (1999). The album showcased
        Muse's aggressive yet melancholic musical style, with lyrics about
        relationships and their difficulties trying to establish themselves in
        their hometown.

        During the production of their second album, Origin of Symmetry (2001),
        Muse experimented with instrumentation such as a church organ,
        Mellotron, animal bones, and an expanded drum kit. There was more of
        Bellamy's falsetto, arpeggiated guitar, and piano playing. Bellamy cites
        guitar influences such as Jimi Hendrix and Tom Morello (of Rage Against
        the Machine), the latter evident in the more riff-based songs in Origin
        of Symmetry and in Bellamy's use of guitar pitch-shifting effects. The
        album features a cover of Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse's "Feeling
        Good", voted in various polls one of the greatest cover versions of all
        time. It was released as a double A-side single, "Hyper Music/Feeling
        Good". Origin of Symmetry received positive reviews by critics; NME gave
        the album 9/10 and wrote: "It's amazing for such a young band to load up
        with a heritage that includes the darker visions of Cobain and Kafka,
        Mahler and The Tiger Lillies, Cronenberg and Schoenberg, and make a
        sexy, populist album." Maverick, Muse's American label, did not consider
        Bellamy's vocals "radio-friendly" and asked Muse to rerecord the song
        for the US release. The band refused and left Maverick; the album was
        not released in the US until September 2005, after Muse signed to Warner
        Bros. Origin of Symmetry has made appearances on lists of the greatest
        rock albums of the 2000s, both poll-based and on publication lists. In
        2006, it placed at number 74 on Q magazine's list of the 100 Greatest
        Albums of All-Time, while in February 2008, the album placed at number
        28 on a list of the Best British Albums of All Time determined by the
        magazine's readers. Kerrang! placed the album at number 20 in its 100
        Best British Rock Albums Ever! List and at number 13 on its 50 Best
        Albums of the 21st Century list. Acclaimed Music ranks Origin of
        Symmetry as the 1,247th greatest album of all time. In 2002, Muse
        released the first live DVD, Hullabaloo, featuring footage recorded
        during Muse's two gigs at Le Zenith in Paris in 2001, and a documentary
        film of the band on tour. A double album, Hullabaloo Soundtrack, was
        released at the same time, containing a compilation of B-sides and a
        disc of recordings of songs from the Le Zenith performances. A double-A
        side single was also released featuring the new songs "In Your World"
        and "Dead Star". In 2002, Muse threatened Celine Dion with legal action
        when she planned to name her Las Vegas show "Muse", as Muse have
        worldwide performing rights to the name. Dion offered Muse $50,000 for
        the rights, but they turned it down and Dion backed down. Bellamy said:
        "We don't want to turn up there with people thinking we're Celine Dion's
        backing band."

        Muse's third album, Absolution, produced by Rich Costey, Paul Reeve and
        John Cornfield was released on 15 September 2003. It debuted at number
        one in the UK and produced Muse's first top-ten hit, "Time Is Running
        Out", and three top-twenty hits: "Hysteria", "Sing for Absolution" and
        "Butterflies and Hurricanes". Absolution was eventually certified gold
        in the US. Muse undertook a year-long international tour in support of
        the album, visiting Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Canada,
        and France. On the 2004 US leg of the tour, Bellamy injured himself
        onstage during the opening show in Atlanta; the tour resumed after
        Bellamy received stitches. In June 2004, Muse headlined the Glastonbury
        Festival, which they later described as "the best gig of our lives".
        Howard's father, William Howard, who attended the festival to watch the
        band, died from a heart attack shortly after the performance. Bellamy
        said: "It was the biggest feeling of achievement we've ever had after
        coming offstage. It was almost surreal that an hour later his dad died.
        It was almost not believable. We spent about a week sort of just with
        Dom trying to support him. I think he was happy that at least his dad
        got to see him at probably what was the finest moment so far of the
        band's life." Muse won two MTV Europe awards, including "Best
        Alternative Act", and a Q Award for "Best Live Act", and received an
        award for "Best British Live Act" at the Brit Awards. On 2 July 2005,
        they participated in the Live 8 concert in Paris. In 2003, the band
        successfully sued Nestlé for using their cover "Feeling Good" for a
        Nescafé advertisement without permission and donated the money won from
        the lawsuit to Oxfam. An unofficial DVD biography, Manic Depression, was
        released in April 2005. Muse released another live DVD on 12 December
        2005, Absolution Tour, containing edited and remastered highlights from
        their Glastonbury performance unseen footage from their performances at
        London Earls Court, Wembley Arena, and the Wiltern Theatre in Los
        Angeles. During the 2004 Absolution tour, Bellamy smashed 140 guitars, a
        world record for the most guitars smashed in a tour.

        In 2006, Muse released their fourth album, Black Holes and Revelations,
        co-produced once again with Rich Costey. The album's title and themes
        reflect the band's interest in science fiction.[41][42] The album
        charted at number one in the UK, much of Europe, and Australia. In the
        US, it reached number nine on the Billboard 200. Before the release of
        the new album, Muse made several promotional TV appearances starting on
        13 May 2006 at BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend. The Black Holes and
        Revelations Tour started before the release of their album and initially
        consisted mostly of festival appearances, including a headline slot at
        the Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2006. The band's main touring
        itinerary started with a tour of North America from late July to early
        August 2006. After the last of the summer festivals, a tour of Europe
        began, including a large arena tour of the UK. Black Holes and
        Revelations was nominated for the 2006 Mercury Music Prize, but lost to
        Arctic Monkeys. It earned a Platinum Europe Award after selling one
        million copies in Europe. The first single from the album, "Supermassive
        Black Hole", was released as a download in May 2006. In August 2006,
        Muse recorded a live session at Abbey Road Studios for the Live from
        Abbey Road television show. The second single, "Starlight", was released
        in September 2006. "Knights of Cydonia" was released in the US as a
        radio-only single in June 2006 and in the UK in November 2006. The
        fourth single, "Invincible", was released in April 2007. Another single,
        "Map of the Problematique", was released for download only in June 2007,
        following the band's performance at Wembley Stadium. Muse at the Rock im
        Park, Germany in October 2007 Muse spent November and much of December
        2006 touring Europe with British band Noisettes as the supporting act.
        The tour continued in Australia, New Zealand, and Southeast Asia in
        early 2007 before returning to England for the summer. At the 2007 Brit
        Awards in February, Muse received their second award for Best British
        Live Act. They performed two gigs at the newly rebuilt Wembley Stadium
        on 16 and 17 June 2007, where they became the first band to sell out the
        venue. Both concerts were recorded for a DVD/CD, HAARP, released in
        early 2008. It was named the 40th greatest live album of all time by
        NME. The tour continued across Europe in July 2007 before returning to
        the US in August, where Muse played to a sold-out crowd at Madison
        Square Garden, New York City. They headlined the second night of the
        Austin City Limits Music Festival on 15 September 2007, and performed at
        the October 2007 Vegoose in Las Vegas with bands including Rage Against
        the Machine, Daft Punk and Queens of the Stone Age. Muse continued
        touring in Eastern Europe, Russia, Scandinavia, Australia, and New
        Zealand in 2007 before going to South Africa, Portugal, Mexico,
        Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Brazil, Ireland, and the UK in 2008. On 12
        April, they played a one-off concert at the Royal Albert Hall, London in
        aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust. Muse performed at Rock in Rio Lisboa on
        6 June 2008, alongside bands including Kaiser Chiefs, The Offspring and
        Linkin Park. They also performed in Marlay Park, Dublin, on 13 August. A
        few days later, Muse headlined the 2008 V Festival, playing in
        Chelmsford on Saturday 16 August and Staffordshire on Sunday 17 August.
        On 25 September 2008, Bellamy, Howard and Wolstenholme all received an
        Honorary Doctorate of Arts from the University of Plymouth for their
        contributions to music.
